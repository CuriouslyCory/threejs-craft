# Orchestration State: {{INTEGRATION_BRANCH}}

Source of truth for this run. Update after every state change (plan saved, agent dispatched, gate passed, branch merged). If the run is interrupted, read this file first to resume.

- Integration branch: `{{INTEGRATION_BRANCH}}`
- Base branch / final PR target: `{{BASE_BRANCH}}`
- PR model: `{{PR_MODEL}}`
- Tracking context: {{TRACKING_ISSUE_URL_OR_CONTEXT}}
- Last updated: <YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM> by orchestrator

## Status legend

- `not-started` no worktree yet
- `planning` running the per-item planning step
- `planned` plan file written, ready for agents
- `in-progress` specialist agents executing
- `review` review steps running
- `fixing` applying review fixes
- `verified` build, lint, typecheck, tests, and acceptance criteria all green in the worktree
- `merged` merged into integration and integration re-verified
- `blocked` waiting on a dependency or a failed gate (see Notes)

{{WAVE_TABLES}}

<!-- Each wave table:
## Wave N ({{parallel|sequential}}): branch from {{base or post-wave-(N-1) integration tip}}

| Item | Slug / branch | Worktree | Tracker key | Depends on | Plan file | Status | Merged |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| #<id> | `feat/<slug>` | `../wt-<id>` | <key> | <deps> | `plans/<id>.md` | not-started | no |
-->

## Verification gates

Record pass/fail and date when each item clears its gate in-worktree, before merge.

| Item | Build | Lint | Typecheck | Tests | Acceptance criteria | Item-specific check |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
{{VERIFICATION_GATE_ROWS}}

## Integration re-verification log

After each merge, re-run `pnpm build`, `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, and `pnpm test` on the integration branch and log the result.

| Date | After merging | Build | Lint | Typecheck | Tests | Conflicts resolved | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
{{REVERIFY_ROWS}}

## Decisions / ADRs to confirm

| Decision | Item | Recorded | Confirmed at PR review |

{{DECISION_ROWS}}

## Finalization checklist

- [ ] All items show `merged`
- [ ] Final full `pnpm build`, `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, and `pnpm test` all green on `{{INTEGRATION_BRANCH}}`
- [ ] PR opened into `{{BASE_BRANCH}}` per the configured PR model
- [ ] PR body includes `Closes <id>` for every item
- [ ] PR body summarizes every decision/ADR for sign-off
- [ ] All worktrees removed; merged item branches deleted
- [ ] Final PR left for human review (orchestrator does not self-merge)

## Notes and blockers

Use this space for anything that affected the run: a failed gate and how it was resolved, a conflict during integration, a decision rationale, or a reason an item is `blocked`.
