/**
 * `WorldStore` — the one deep module for world state: it owns the `World` +
 * `Inventory` for a play session, exposes `apply(command)` built directly on
 * `applyCommand` (the mutation seam a future remote adapter per ADR-0001
 * will stand behind), and exposes a single versioned, key-carrying
 * `getSnapshot()`/`subscribe()` pair for `useSyncExternalStore`.
 *
 * #20: an optional `onCommit(command, changed)` hook, fired from inside
 * `apply`'s `if (result.ok)` block after the local mutation is fully
 * committed, is this store's only seam for persistence — `game-scene.tsx`
 * wires it to a `PersistQueue.enqueue` for signed-in players and leaves it
 * `undefined` for the signed-out ephemeral world. It never fires on a
 * rejected command and is only reachable via `apply`'s pointerdown-driven
 * call path, so it adds no per-frame work.
 *
 * This module merges what used to be three shallow pieces: the mutation
 * store (`GameStore`, #8), the read-only chunk-enumeration surface
 * (`WorldSource`/`LocalWorldSource`/`createLocalWorldStore`, #6/#10), and the
 * identity pass-through `RemoteWorldSource` (#10) that merely proved the
 * read surface was swappable. Folding them into one `WorldStore` also fixes
 * a render bug: because the old read surface (`LocalWorldSource.chunkEntries()`)
 * was snapshotted once at mount in `game-scene.tsx`, a chunk first created by
 * an edit (e.g. building up past existing terrain into a new chunk layer)
 * was mutated correctly but never entered the mounted chunk list, so no mesh
 * was ever mounted for it. Here, chunk *existence* is part of the same
 * versioned `getSnapshot()` the render layer subscribes to via
 * `useSyncExternalStore`, so a newly created chunk appears on the very next
 * render.
 *
 * `getSnapshot()` is rebuilt only inside `apply()` on a successful mutation,
 * and reuses the cached entry object for any chunk whose `(chunk, version)`
 * pair didn't change — preserving the O(dirty-chunks) rebuild invariant
 * (`ChunkMesh`'s `useMemo([chunk, origin, version])` only recomputes for the
 * chunk(s) that actually changed) and satisfying `useSyncExternalStore`'s
 * "getSnapshot must be cached" contract (a stable reference when nothing
 * changed).
